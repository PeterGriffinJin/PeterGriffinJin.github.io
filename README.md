I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, fortunately advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). During the past, I spent time at Google, Amazon Search, and Microsoft Research (both Redmond and Beijing).

My research is supported by [**Apple PhD Fellowship**](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2024) and [**Yunni and Maxine Pao Memorial Fellowship**](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/awards/graduate-fellowships-awards/yunni-and-maxine-pao-memorial-fellowship). For further information, please see my [CV](Bowen__CV.pdf) (last update: 2024.5.6).

**Research Interests**: My main research lies at the intersection of large generative models (e.g., large language models and diffusion models), multimodal data and information networks. In particular, I focus on how large models can integrate text, network, and multimodal data for solving real world problems including information retrieval and knowledge discovery. My current research interest is **LLM alignment** and **RLHF**.
<!-- My current research interests lie in mining unstructured data (e.g., text), structured data (e.g., table, graph) and their intersection. I also had former experience in Recommender System, Information Extraction and Information Retrieval. -->

- **Large Generative Models + Graphs** ([Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02783)): representation learning ([Heterformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10282), [Edgeformers](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=2YQrqe4RNv)), pretraining ([Patton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12268)), graph plug-in ([Graph-CoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07103)) and multimodal synthesis ([InstructG2I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07157)).

- **Large Generative Models + Science** ([Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10833)): general science ([MAPLE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03341), [ToTER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04160)), geospatial science ([GeoWise](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611978032.55)), climate science ([CoDiCast](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05975)) and healthcare ([RAM-EHR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00815)).
