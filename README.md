I am a 2nd-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University, where I was fortunated to be advised by Prof. [Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). During the past, I spent time at Microsoft Research (both Redmond and Beijing), UCLA and Umich.

For further information, please see my [CV](Bowen___CV.pdf).

**Research Interests**: My current research interests lie in unstructured data (e.g., text) modeling, structured data (e.g., table, graph) and their intersection.
