I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, fortunately advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering of Tsinghua University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yong Li](http://fi.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/~liyong/). During the past, I spent time at Microsoft Research (both Redmond and Beijing), UCLA and Umich.

For further information, please see my [CV](Bowen__CV.pdf).

**Research Interests**: My current research interests lie in mining unstructured data (e.g., text), structured data (e.g., table, graph) and their intersection. I also had former experience in Recommender System, Information Extraction and Information Retrieval.

I am maintaining an awesome github repo on [**Language Models on Graphs**](https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Awesome-Language-Model-on-Graphs). Feel free to have a look!

## Miscellaneous
I started to play a traditional Chinese instrument, Sheng at the age of eight. <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jv411V7Nt?from=search&seid=17941530779930110754">Here is a concert record of mine.</a> Hope you enjoy it!:)

I'm a "universal" ball fan and enjoy working out. If you cannot find me in office, catch me at the gym. <a title="ÂìàÂìà" href="https://emojixd.com/x7pu">üòÉ</a>
