## Abstract

Graphs and textual data are both fundamental in the realm of data mining, each with its own unique features that often necessitate specialized modeling techniques. Traditionally, technologies for graph mining and text mining have been developed independently. However, in many real-world applications, these two data modalities frequently coexist and complement each other. For example, in e-commerce platforms, user-product interaction graphs and product descriptions provide different but complementary perspectives on product characteristics. Likewise, in scientific research, citation networks, author information, and the textual content of papers collectively shape the understanding of a paperâ€™s impact.

In this tutorial, we will focus on recent advances in graph mining techniques that harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), as well as improvements in text mining methods through the integration of graph structure information. Our goal is to present a cohesive framework illustrating how the synergy between graph and text modalities can lead to richer insights and more profound knowledge discovery. The key topics covered will include:

(1) An introduction to how graph and text data are interlinked in real-world applications and how models like graph neural networks and large language models are designed to capture signals from both modalities;

(2) **Network mining with language models**: methods that utilize language models for representation learning on graphs and pretraining language models with graph data;

(3) **Text mining with structural information**: approaches to text classification, document retrieval, and question answering, where graph structures serve as auxiliary information;

(4) Progressing towards an integrated paradigm for mining both semantics and structural information in a unified framework.

This comprehensive exploration will provide insights into how combining graph structures and textual data can enhance the capabilities of modern machine-learning techniques.
The tutorial will be presented in 2 hours.
